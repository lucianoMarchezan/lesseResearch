Software product line (SPL) scoping aids companies to define the boundaries of their products. As scoping guides the management of the resources in SPL development, it is one of the core activities in this process. One may find in the literature, several approaches on this topic, proposing techniques and methodologies to be applicable in different organizational scenarios. Due to the importance of such approaches, there is a need for an update in the state of the art in this field. In this context, we look into identifying, analyzing and extracting important information from SPL scoping proposals found in the literature. This important information includes similarities and differences among these approaches as well as business aspects and research opportunities. Thus, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) alongside snowballing, following a well-defined protocol to retrieve, classify and extract information from the literature.  We analyzed a total of 45 which studies, identifying 33 different proposals and the major approaches in the field, highlighting their similarities and differences and establishing a generic scoping process. Furthermore, research opportunities in the SPL scoping field are discussed.
